eng version in case cannot encode TH language

problem:
	- desire the values in column "month" to be collected as date data type (format is m/yyyy)
	solution?:
		- add a random day's number to make the format correct
		- split month and year but there's a 'month' has day's number in it	
	
	- have no idea how data is actually collected cause there's a column name has day's number(d/m/yyyy)
	which the others don't (m/yyyy)
	
	- pipeline doesn't have schedule yet due to uncertainty of data collecting (maybe and no extraction)

key takeaway:
	- .env isn't in the docker volume (if is edited, it need to be compose down and up again)

	- pipeline write to database only new apps and the numbers of new month(s) only. Will have a problem if
	there are data collecting retrospectively

	- there are to_excel function in did-test.py to write the result out, in case want to check before
	write_database

	- external is the directory for docker volume

	- .gitignore is a list of files that are not used except .env and raw data files
